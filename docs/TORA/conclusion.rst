Conclusion
==========

This document has provided the explanation, implementation and evaluation of the Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) which was first introduced in 1997. The algorithm is a distributed routing protocol that is designed to be used in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). The main benefits of this algorithm are it being highly adaptable to network changes and providing multi-path routes to prevent congestion. In section 1.2 we describe the algorithm at the high-level and provided an example of how it works. The algorithm is based on the concept of link reversal and is used to establish and maintain routes in the network. In section 1.3 and 1.4 we tested it with different topologies and number of nodes, then discussed the implications of the results.
