This report will describe the Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) along with it's implementation in accordance to the Ad Hoc Computing (AHC) Framework. TORA is a routing algorithm used in wireless mesh networks. TORA ensures loop-free routes and has the ability to react to topological change, minimizing communication overhead and providing multiple routes for source/destination pairs. This document will provide detail on the TORA implementation in accordance to AHC framework, some evaluation result by benchmarking the algorithm and a discussion on the results.
